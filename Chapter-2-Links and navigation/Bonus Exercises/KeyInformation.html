    <h2>Key Information</h2>
    <h1> This show was based on J.G. Quintel's 2 in the AM PM (2006), which was about two gas station clerks who take acid trips after eating two pieces of acid-filled candy. The first clerk was played by J.G. Quintel, the creator of this show, and he was named after him as well. The second clerk was played by Sam Marin, who played Benson, and was named after him. The short never aired on television, due to having a ton of swear words, but is on YouTube however.</h1>
